## ABOUT THE PROJECT
Aspiring Developers were put together as a team in order to identify a real-world problem and create a website to solve the issue. This will be done using data received from multiple server-side API requests. 

Developers identified an issue Movie enthusiasts were facing since the pandemic hit. In order to to determine the success of a movie, many movie buffs used how much movies grossed in theaters. But ever since the pandemic hit this has not been a reliable method to determine the success of the movie as theaters were closed for long periods of time and the one that were open only allowed limited viewers per show. 

This is where developers realised by combining reported covid-19 cases with the movies released from a period from March of 2020 to March of 2021, the correlation between the time period the movie was released and the status of covid cases at the time can explain how a movie did at the time of its release in theaters.
